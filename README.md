# python-number-chooser
## About
My first Python project!\
This project uses Python 3.8.5.\
Older version of Python should work.
## Instructions
Configure the `min` variable to the desired minimum number.\
Configure the `max` variable to the desired maximum number.\
Simple as that.
## Notes
- Code explanation is in the `main.py` file.
- You can run the `run.bat` file for easy execution on Windows.
