## About
My first Python project!\
This project uses Python `v3.8.5`.\
Older versions of Python should work.
## Instructions
Execute the file.\
Do what the text says.\
Simple as that.
## Notes
- Code explanation is in the `main.py` file.
- You can run the `run.bat` file for easy execution on Windows.
